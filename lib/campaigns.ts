    transcript: `
NewMoney is a New Zealand-founded fintech building stable, transparent digital cash for Kiwis and Aussies.
Its first two stablecoins are dNZD (digital New Zealand Dollar) and dAUD (digital Australian Dollar).

Every dNZD token is fully backed 1:1 by fiat reserves held in trust in a New Zealand-registered bank.
The trust is administered by NewMoney NZ Nominee Limited under a New Zealand bare-trust structure, which
means every token represents a direct and redeemable beneficial interest in real cash.

dNZD is a blockchain-based digital representation of the New Zealand Dollar. It is currently live on the
Ethereum, Base, Polygon, and Solana networks, with cross-chain functionality enabled by an integration
with LayerZero. More networks are joining every week.

Primary issuance and redemption are available only to wholesale counterparties in New Zealand. The
stablecoins themselves are not financial products. They are governed exclusively by New Zealand law.

NewMoney's mission is to be the most trusted, transparent, integrated, and practical digital dollar for
everyday use - giving people the freedom of open money: faster, simpler, borderless. The team combines
deep institutional fluency with DeFi-native innovation, reducing FX drag across trans-Tasman and global
flows. Use cases include DeFi earning vaults, payment networks, stablecoin FX, payroll, and anything
that disrupts the status quo.

    transcript: `
A crypto wallet is not a place that stores coins. It stores keys — specifically, private keys that prove
ownership of assets recorded on a blockchain.

Think of the blockchain as a public ledger. Your wallet holds the password (private key) that lets you
authorise entries in that ledger. The coins never leave the chain; only control of them moves.

There are two main types of wallets:

1. Custodial wallets: A company (like Coinbase or Binance) holds your private keys for you. Easy to use,
   but if the company is hacked or goes bankrupt, you may lose access. "Not your keys, not your coins."

2. Non-custodial wallets: You hold your own private key via a seed phrase — 12 or 24 random words.
   MetaMask and Phantom are popular examples. You are fully in control. If you lose the seed phrase,
   there is no recovery.

Key concepts:
- Public key / address: Like your bank account number. Share it freely to receive funds.
- Private key: Like your PIN. Never share it. Anyone who has it can take everything.
- Seed phrase: A human-readable backup of your private key. Store it offline, never digitally.

To stay safe:
- Write your seed phrase on paper and store it somewhere physically secure.
- Never enter your seed phrase on a website.
- Use a hardware wallet (like Ledger or Trezor) for large amounts — it keeps the private key offline.
- Verify every transaction before signing. Malicious apps can request unlimited spending approvals.

For dNZD, you need a compatible wallet like MetaMask (for Ethereum/Base/Polygon) or Phantom (for Solana).
When you connect to L2Earn, we never ask for your private key — only a signature to verify ownership.

    rewardCents: 300,
    tags: ["Blockchain", "Beginners", "Crypto"],
    transcript: `
A blockchain is a database — but one that's shared across thousands of computers simultaneously, making it
almost impossible to falsify without the consensus of the whole network.

Traditional databases have a single owner (a company or government) who can change, delete, or freeze
records. A blockchain has no single owner. Records are permanent once confirmed.

How it works:

1. Transactions: When you send dNZD to someone, you broadcast a transaction to the network. It says:
   "I, wallet A, authorise sending X dNZD to wallet B." You sign it with your private key.

2. Mempool: Transactions wait in a pool called the mempool until a validator (miner or staker) picks them up.

3. Blocks: Validators bundle transactions into blocks. Each block contains: the transactions, a timestamp,
   and a cryptographic hash of the previous block. This chain of hashes is why it's called a blockchain.

4. Consensus: Before a block is added, validators run a consensus algorithm. On Bitcoin it's Proof of Work
   (energy-intensive mining). Ethereum uses Proof of Stake (validators lock up ETH as collateral). Both
   prevent a single party from faking the chain.

5. Finality: Once confirmed (usually after a few more blocks are added on top), a transaction is effectively
   irreversible. No one can modify it without recalculating all the subsequent blocks and convincing the
   whole network — computationally infeasible.

Why this matters for money:
- No central authority can freeze your funds
- Transactions settle in minutes, not days
- Anyone with internet access can participate
- All transactions are publicly auditable
- Smart contracts automate agreements without middlemen

dNZD uses these properties to create a New Zealand Dollar that works at internet speed, globally, 24/7.

    transcript: `
Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged to an external reference,
most commonly a fiat currency like USD, NZD, or AUD. They solve a critical problem in crypto: volatility.

Bitcoin and Ethereum fluctuate wildly - sometimes 10% or more in a single day. This makes them unsuitable
for everyday payments, payroll, or commerce. You can't price your coffee in Bitcoin if it could be worth
double tomorrow or half as much. Stablecoins bridge this gap.

There are three main types of stablecoins:

1. Fiat-backed: Fully collateralized by fiat currency in banks (like dNZD). These are the most transparent
   and offer the strongest stability guarantees. Every coin represents a claim on real cash.

2. Crypto-backed: Collateralized by other cryptocurrencies, typically in excess (e.g., 150% backing).
   These require complex mechanisms to maintain the peg and carry counterparty risk.

3. Algorithmic: Maintained by code and incentive mechanisms rather than collateral. These have historically
   been unstable and risky.

dNZD is fiat-backed by NewMoney. Every token in circulation is backed 1:1 by NZD held in a New Zealand-registered
bank under a bare-trust structure. This means dNZD holders have a direct claim on the underlying cash.

Stablecoins enable:
- Fast cross-border payments without FX middlemen
- 24/7 settlement (no banking hours)
- Programmable money for smart contracts and DeFi
- Reliable unit of account for commerce and loans
- Freedom for unbanked populations to access stable currency

DeFi (Decentralized Finance) is financial infrastructure built on public blockchains where transactions
settle in code rather than through centralized intermediaries like banks. Stablecoins like dNZD are the
foundation of DeFi: they're the reliable medium of exchange, unit of account, and store of value.

NewMoney's vision is "open money" - fast, simpler, borderless financial systems that reduce friction and costs.
Traditional finance charges fees at every step: bank transfers, FX conversions, intermediaries all take cuts.

With dNZD on public blockchains, users can:

1. Send money 24/7/365 without banking hours. A transaction settles in minutes, not days.

2. Reduce FX drag: Trans-Tasman and global flows no longer need to pass through multiple currency conversions
   and correspondent banks. Send dNZD directly, reducing costs by 50% or more.

3. Earn yield: DeFi protocols let dNZD holders deposit their funds into "earning vaults" that generate returns
   from lending, liquidity provision, and other strategies. This is accessible to anyone with a crypto wallet.

4. Access credit without a bank: Smart contracts can programmatically issue loans backed by dNZD collateral,
   opening credit to people excluded from traditional banking.

5. Programmable money: Businesses can automate payroll, subscriptions, and payments with code. Money flows
   instantly on a schedule or trigger condition.

6. Payroll at scale: Companies can pay global teams instantly in dNZD, avoiding SWIFT fees and delays.

NewMoney combines "deep institutional fluency with DeFi-native innovation" - meaning they understand both
traditional finance and blockchain, building bridges between them for everyday users, not just speculators.

The freedom of open money means lower costs, faster settlement, and financial inclusion for all.

Trust is the foundation of money. Historically, people trusted central banks to manage fiat currency responsibly.
In crypto, trust has often been misplaced: many stablecoins have failed, collapsed, or lost their peg entirely.

NewMoney builds trust through radical transparency and regulated reserve backing.

Every dNZD token is backed 1:1 by fiat reserves held in a New Zealand-registered bank. This means:

1. For every dNZD in circulation, there is exactly one real NZD sitting in a trust account.

2. The trust is administered by "NewMoney NZ Nominee Limited" under a New Zealand bare-trust structure.
   This is legal language meaning: the trust is registered, regulated by NZ law, and the token holders
   have direct beneficial interest in the cash.

3. If NewMoney the company fails, the cash does not belong to the company - it's held in trust for token holders.
   Your dNZD remains redeemable for real cash independently of company status.

4. New Zealand law governs dNZD. It's not an experiment or a gray area - it's a formal, regulated instrument.

This contrasts with algorithmic stablecoins (which depend on code and incentive mechanisms and can fail) or
under-collateralized crypto-backed stablecoins (which carry counterparty risk and can decouple from their peg).

Compare to historical failures:
- Terra/Luna: Algorithmic stablecoin that promised stability through incentives. It collapsed spectacularly in 2022,
  losing billions of dollars in value. Investors lost their savings.
- Stablecoin X: A project that claimed 1:1 backing but actually held less cash than coins in circulation. When
  scrutiny arrived, it collapsed.

NewMoney's approach is different: full, real, auditable backing by fiat cash in a regulated bank under NZ law.

This model scales, survives company failures, and gives users legitimate confidence in redemption.

The blockchain ecosystem is fragmented. Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, Base, Arbitrum - each is a separate network
with different communities, liquidity, and use cases. Users and developers often need stablecoins to move between them.

Historically, this was a pain: you'd have to bridge through centralized exchanges, losing liquidity and paying fees.
Cross-chain messaging was unreliable, and many bridges have been hacked, resulting in billions in losses.

NewMoney uses LayerZero, a protocol that enables secure cross-chain messaging without relying on wrapped tokens,
liquidity pools, or centralized bridges.

How it works:

1. LayerZero connects blockchains with programmable smart contracts. A transaction on Ethereum can trigger code
   on Solana reliably.

2. Instead of managing separate tokens (wrapped dNZD on Polygon, bridged dNZD on Base, etc.), dNZD uses a single
   canonical token with LayerZero's Omnichain Fungible Token (OFT) standard.

3. When you send dNZD from Ethereum to Solana, the LayerZero network verifies the transaction and atomically
   mints on the destination chain. Your dNZD is fungible and interchangeable everywhere.

4. This is safer, cheaper, and faster than traditional bridges because there's no centralized liquidity pool
   or wrapped token overhead.

Benefits:

- Composability: DeFi protocols on any chain can use dNZD as a base unit without worrying about bridge fragmentation.
- Liquidity: Instead of fragmented pools on each chain, dNZD liquidity is essentially global and unified.
- Security: LayerZero is maintained by a decentralized network of validators and relies on cryptographic proofs,
  not centralized operators.
- Scalability: As new chains launch, NewMoney can integrate them via LayerZero - "more networks are joining every week."

NewMoney's cross-chain strategy positions dNZD as a global settlement layer: one digital dollar that works
everywhere, enabling truly borderless finance.

DeFi (Decentralized Finance) is financial infrastructure built on public blockchains where transactions
settle in code rather than through centralized intermediaries like banks. Stablecoins like dNZD are the
foundation of DeFi: they're the reliable medium of exchange, unit of account, and store of value.

NewMoney's vision is "open money" - fast, simpler, borderless financial systems that reduce friction and costs.
Traditional finance charges fees at every step: bank transfers, FX conversions, intermediaries all take cuts.

With dNZD on public blockchains, users can:

1. Send money 24/7/365 without banking hours. A transaction settles in minutes, not days.

2. Reduce FX drag: Trans-Tasman and global flows no longer need to pass through multiple currency conversions
   and correspondent banks. Send dNZD directly, reducing costs by 50% or more.

3. Earn yield: DeFi protocols let dNZD holders deposit their funds into "earning vaults" that generate returns
   from lending, liquidity provision, and other strategies. This is accessible to anyone with a crypto wallet.

4. Access credit without a bank: Smart contracts can programmatically issue loans backed by dNZD collateral,
   opening credit to people excluded from traditional banking.

5. Programmable money: Businesses can automate payroll, subscriptions, and payments with code. Money flows
   instantly on a schedule or trigger condition.

6. Payroll at scale: Companies can pay global teams instantly in dNZD, avoiding SWIFT fees and delays.

NewMoney combines "deep institutional fluency with DeFi-native innovation" - meaning they understand both
traditional finance and blockchain, building bridges between them for everyday users, not just speculators.

The freedom of open money means lower costs, faster settlement, and financial inclusion for all.

    transcript: `
Trust is the foundation of money. Historically, people trusted central banks to manage fiat currency responsibly.
In crypto, trust has often been misplaced: many stablecoins have failed, collapsed, or lost their peg entirely.

NewMoney builds trust through radical transparency and regulated reserve backing.

Every dNZD token is backed 1:1 by fiat reserves held in a New Zealand-registered bank. This means:

1. For every dNZD in circulation, there is exactly one real NZD sitting in a trust account.

2. The trust is administered by "NewMoney NZ Nominee Limited" under a New Zealand bare-trust structure.
   This is legal language meaning: the trust is registered, regulated by NZ law, and the token holders
   have direct beneficial interest in the cash.

3. If NewMoney the company fails, the cash does not belong to the company - it's held in trust for token holders.
   Your dNZD remains redeemable for real cash independently of company status.

4. New Zealand law governs dNZD. It's not an experiment or a gray area - it's a formal, regulated instrument.

This contrasts with algorithmic stablecoins (which depend on code and incentive mechanisms and can fail) or
under-collateralized crypto-backed stablecoins (which carry counterparty risk and can decouple from their peg).

Compare to historical failures:
- Terra/Luna: Algorithmic stablecoin that promised stability through incentives. It collapsed spectacularly in 2022,
  losing billions of dollars in value. Investors lost their savings.
- Stablecoin X: A project that claimed 1:1 backing but actually held less cash than coins in circulation. When
  scrutiny arrived, it collapsed.

NewMoney's approach is different: full, real, auditable backing by fiat cash in a regulated bank under NZ law.

This model scales, survives company failures, and gives users legitimate confidence in redemption.

    tags: ["DeFi", "Yield", "Vaults", "APY"],
    transcript: `
DeFi yield vaults let you earn a return on your stablecoins without handing control to a bank.
Instead of depositing dNZD in a savings account earning near-zero interest, DeFi protocols connect
lenders directly with borrowers through smart contracts — and you keep custody of your funds.

How lending protocols work (e.g., Aave, Compound):

1. You deposit dNZD into a smart contract (the lending pool).
2. Borrowers take dNZD loans by posting crypto collateral (usually 130-150% of the loan value).
3. Borrowers pay interest. That interest is distributed to depositors like you.
4. Because the protocol is over-collateralised, even if a borrower defaults, liquidation mechanisms
   sell their collateral to repay the pool.

APY (Annual Percentage Yield) tells you the annualised return including compounding. A 5% APY on
100 dNZD means you'd expect roughly 5 dNZD after a year if rates hold.

Liquidity pools (e.g., Uniswap, Curve):

You can also provide liquidity to trading pairs. When traders swap between dNZD and another token,
they pay a fee that goes to liquidity providers. You earn a share proportional to your contribution.

Risks to understand:

- Smart contract risk: Code can have bugs. Audited protocols are safer but not risk-free.
- Impermanent loss: In liquidity pools, price divergence between paired assets can reduce your net value.
- Liquidation risk (for borrowers): If collateral drops in value, your position may be liquidated.
- Rate variability: APYs are variable and can drop significantly.

NewMoney's vision includes dNZD-powered "earning vaults" that let everyday Kiwis access these yields
while holding a stable, NZD-denominated asset — no crypto volatility, just yield.

    tags: ["Security", "Web3", "Self-custody"],
    transcript: `
Web3 puts you in control of your money — but that means attackers target you directly, not a company's servers.
Understanding common attack vectors is essential before interacting with DeFi, NFTs, or any dApp.

Common attack types:

1. Phishing: Fake websites that look identical to real ones (MetaMask, Uniswap, OpenSea). They ask you
   to "connect your wallet" or "enter your seed phrase." Once you do, funds are stolen immediately.
   Defence: Always check the URL. Bookmark official sites. Never enter your seed phrase online.

2. Malicious token approvals (allowance attacks): DeFi requires you to "approve" contracts to spend
   your tokens. A malicious contract can request unlimited approval. If you grant it, the attacker
   can drain your wallet later without any further interaction.
   Defence: Use a tool like revoke.cash to review and revoke approvals. Never approve unlimited amounts
   from unknown sites.

3. Rug pulls: A project launches, raises money, then the developers drain the liquidity pool or
   treasury and disappear. Signs: anonymous team, no audit, no locked liquidity, sudden token launch.
   Defence: Research teams, look for audits, check if liquidity is locked.

4. Honeypot tokens: You can buy a token but the contract prevents you from selling it. By the time
   you realise, the price has been pumped and dumped.
   Defence: Check the contract on a honeypot detector before buying unknown tokens.

5. Social engineering: Fake "support" on Discord/Twitter claiming to help, then asking for your
   seed phrase. Legitimate support will NEVER ask for your seed phrase.

6. Address poisoning: Attackers send tiny transactions from addresses that look similar to your
   usual contacts, hoping you'll copy the wrong address.
   Defence: Always verify the full address, not just the first/last few characters.

General rules:
- Hardware wallets for large balances
- Separate wallet for DeFi interactions
- Never rush — scammers create artificial urgency

Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) is an open-source protocol for making and verifying on-chain attestations.
An attestation is a signed, verifiable claim: "Entity A asserts that Entity B has done/is X."

Think of it like a digital stamp: a university says "this person graduated," a government says "this person
is a citizen," or in our case, L2Earn says "this wallet passed the dNZD quiz on date X with score Y."

Unlike NFT certificates (which just prove token ownership), EAS attestations are:
- Signed by a verified attester (not just anyone can issue)
- Composable: other smart contracts and dApps can read and act on them
- Revocable (if the issuer wants)
- Chain-agnostic: EAS is deployed on Ethereum, Base, Optimism, Arbitrum, and others

How EAS works technically:

1. Schema Registry: Attestation types are registered on-chain with a schema. L2Earn's schema might be:
   { address wallet, string campaignId, uint8 score, uint256 timestamp }

2. Attester: L2Earn's backend holds a private key. After a user passes a quiz, we call the EAS contract
   to create a signed attestation with the user's wallet, the campaign ID, their score, and the timestamp.

3. On-chain: The attestation is stored permanently on the blockchain. Anyone can verify it.

4. Verifiable: A future employer, DeFi protocol, DAO, or AI agent can query EAS to confirm
   "wallet 0xABCD completed NewMoney 101 with score 3/3."

Real-world applications:
- Proof of education for DeFi protocol access tiers
- Soulbound credentials for DAOs and governance
- KYC/KYB attestations without sharing personal data
- Reputation systems for freelancers and contributors

The Great Handover: AI agents can read EAS attestations to determine whether a wallet/user has
the credentials required before recommending services, completing transactions, or granting access.
This is the future of machine-readable identity.

The Great Handover is a hypothesis: economic decision-making is gradually shifting from humans to AI agents.
Today, humans google products, compare prices, and buy. Tomorrow, AI agents will research, negotiate, transact,
and report — on behalf of their human principals.

This is not science fiction. It's already happening:
- AI assistants like Claude and GPT already browse the web, call APIs, and make recommendations
- Autonomous agents manage crypto portfolios, execute DeFi strategies, and trade
- Businesses are deploying AI agents for procurement, vendor selection, and supply chain

What changes in a world of AI agents?

1. Machine-readable data becomes the product: If your website isn't structured for AI consumption
   (via APIs, schemas, and standard formats), AI agents won't recommend you.

2. Trust signals shift to on-chain: AI agents need verifiable proof of claims. "This brand is ethical"
   is meaningless. "This wallet has 1,000 EAS attestations confirming successful transactions" is verifiable.

3. Money must be programmable: AI agents can't use bank transfers. They need programmable money —
   stablecoins like dNZD — that they can hold, spend, and receive autonomously via smart contracts.

4. Identity is on-chain: An AI agent managing your DeFi will need to prove, on-chain, that it has
   authority to act. EAS attestations, multisig wallets, and session keys enable this.

L2Earn's response:
- We publish an open machine-readable API: /api/agents/campaigns
- AI agents can read this feed, understand what educational campaigns are available, the reward,
  and the human-readable link to redirect their principals
- Our EAS attestations create a verifiable credential layer that AI agents can query

The three-layer future:
1. Programmable money (dNZD): AI agents can hold and transact autonomously
2. Open APIs: Machine-readable business data, pricing, and offers
3. On-chain credentials (EAS): Verifiable trust without human intermediation

The winners in this transition will be businesses that build for both audiences simultaneously:
humans today, agents tomorrow.
